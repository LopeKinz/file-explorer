# File Explorer

File Explorer is a simple Ruby application built using the FxRuby library. It provides a graphical user interface for navigating and exploring files and directories on your computer.


## Features

- Browse and navigate through the directory structure
- View files and folders in a tree-like structure
- Double-click files to open them using the default system application
- Right-click on files to rename them

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.6 or above)
- FxRuby gem

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-explorer.git
```

2. Install the required gem:

```shell
gem install fxruby
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd file-explorer
```

2. Run the application:
